# Setup Instructions

Clone the Main Repository:git clone https://github.com/nathanfekade/Event_Scheduler_Project.git


Navigate to the Project Directory: cd Event_Scheduler_Project


Ensure Docker is installed



# Running the Application

Build and Run with Docker Compose:docker compose up --build


# Access the Application:
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173/



# Architecture Decisions

Frontend: Vue.js and JavaScript were chosen because I am familiar with the technology


# Assumptions and Shortcuts

Full-Day Events: I implemented a feature for full-day events where users donâ€™t need to specify a time, assuming that no event exceeds 24 hours.


Git History: I accidentaly initialized git both on the backend and frontend separately. As a result, the Git history is not visible in the main repository, but if you want to see the commit history they are in the individual repos
